# NickelMenu (libnm.so)
#
# This tool injects menu items into Nickel.
#
# It should work on firmware 4.6+, but it has only been tested on 4.20.14622. It
# is perfectly safe to try out on any newer firmware version, as it has a lot of
# error checking, and a failsafe mechanism which automatically uninstalls it as
# a last resort.
#
# Place your configuration files in this folder (/mnt/onboard/.adds/nm). They
# can be named anything, and should consist of multiple lines either starting
# with # for a comment, or in one of the the following formats:
#
#   menu_item:<location>:<label>:<action>:<arg>
#     Adds a menu item (spaces around fields are ignored).
#
#     <location>  the menu to add the item to, one of:
#                   main   - the menu in the top-left corner of the home screen
#                   reader - the overflow menu in the reader
#     <label>     the label to show on the menu item (must not contain :)
#     <action>    the type of action to run, one of:
#                   dbg_syslog     - writes a message to syslog (for testing)
#                   dbg_error      - always returns an error (for testing)
#                   dbg_msg        - shows a message (for testing)
#                   dbg_toast      - shows a toast (for testing)
#                   kfmon          - triggers a kfmon action
#                   nickel_setting - toggles a boolean setting
#                   nickel_extras  - opens one of the beta features
#                   nickel_misc    - other stuff which isn't significant enough for its own category
#                   cmd_spawn      - starts another process or script in the background
#                   cmd_output     - runs a command and displays the output
#     <arg>       the argument passed to the action:
#                   dbg_syslog     - the text to write
#                   dbg_error      - the error message
#                   dbg_msg        - the message
#                   dbg_toast      - the message
#                   kfmon          - the filename of the KFMon watched item to launch.
#                                    This is actually the basename of the watch's filename as specified in its KFMon config (i.e., the png).
#                                    You can also check the output of the 'list' command via the kfmon-ipc tool.
#                   nickel_setting - one of:
#                                      invert      - toggles FeatureSettings.InvertScreen (all versions)
#                                      lockscreen  - toggles PowerSettings.UnlockEnabled (4.12.12111+)
#                                      screenshots - toggles FeatureSettings.Screenshots (all versions)
#                                      force_wifi  - toggles DeveloperSettings.ForceWifiOn (note: the setting doesn't apply until you toggle WiFi) (all versions)
#                   nickel_extras - the mimetype of the plugin, or one of:
#                                      web_browser
#                                      unblock_it
#                                      sketch_pad
#                                      solitaire
#                                      sudoku
#                                      word_scramble
#                   nickel_misc    - one of:
#                                      force_usb_connection - forces a usb connection dialog to be shown
#                                      rescan_books         - forces nickel to rescan books
#                                      rescan_books_full    - forces a full usb connect/disconnect cycle
#                   cmd_spawn      - the command line to pass to /bin/sh -c (started in /)
#                   cmd_output     - the timeout in milliseconds (0 < t < 10000), a colon, then the command line to pass to /bin/sh -c (started in /)
#
#   chain:<action>:<arg>
#     Adds an action to the chain that began with the preceding menu_item.
#     Actions are performed in the order they are written.
#     Each chain entry MUST follow the menu_item it is attached to. Another
#     menu_item marks the start of the next chain.
#   
#   on_success:<action>:<arg>
#   on_failure:<action>:<arg>
#     Adds a conditional action that is triggered when the preceeding chain or menu_item fails or succeeds.
#     At most, one of each is allowed, and only one will be executed. If the on_success/on_failure succeeds,
#     the next action in the chain will be triggered as normal.
#
# For example, you might have a configuration file in KOBOeReader/.adds/nm/mystuff like:
#
#   menu_item :main   :Show an Error  :dbg_error      :This is an error message!
#   menu_item :main   :Do Nothing     :cmd_spawn      :sleep 60
#   menu_item :main   :Dump Syslog    :cmd_spawn      :logread > /mnt/onboard/.adds/syslog.log
#   menu_item :main   :Kernel Version :cmd_output     :500:uname -a
#   menu_item :main   :Sketch Pad     :nickel_extras  :sketch_pad
#   menu_item :main   :Plato          :kfmon          :plato.png
#   menu_item :reader :Invert Screen  :nickel_setting :invert
#
# You will need to reboot to see any changes.
#
# If there is an error in the configuration, an item which displays it will be
# added to the main menu. If an internal error occurs, it is written to syslog,
# which can be viewed over telnet or SSH (the username is root) with the command
# logread.
#
# To uninstall NickelMenu, create a file named KOBOeReader/.adds/nm/uninstall,
# or manually uninstall it by deleting libnm.so. You can also uninstall it by
# triggering the failsafe mechanism by turning your Kobo off within 20 seconds
# of turning it on.
